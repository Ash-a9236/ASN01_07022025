## LEARNING OBJECTIVES:

Understand the structure of an HTML document, work with HTML elements (both self-closing and paired
elements), HTML attributes, character encoding, HTML comments, reserved characters, HTML5 semantic
elements, and more. Additionally, learn to apply styling to HTML elements using CSS.
OVERVIEW

For this assignment, you are required to create a single webpage from scratch. Start by choosing a topic or
theme that is of interest to you and build a webpage where the content directly relates to the topic you select.
Potential topic ideas include sports, cars, books, climate change, history, etc. Choose a topic that you’re
passionate about.

## TASK REQUIREMENTS

1. Create a folder named assignment1.

2. Inside the assignment1 folder, create an HTML file named home.html.

3. Define the basic structure (or skeleton) of the home.html document. Ensure it is well-formed and valid
    before adding content to the body section. It’s essential to validate your document beforehand, as
    covered in class.

4. Add an HTML comment block at the start of your document. The comment should include a brief
    description of the webpage, your name, and the date.

5. Your HTML document must include a title. The title should be: "Assignment 1 – [your selected topic]".

6. The main content of your webpage should discuss the theme or topic you’ve chosen, using HTML5
semantic elements for structure. Follow these guidelines to structure your content:

    a. Use a <header> element to enclose a <nav> element.

    b. Include an <article> element.

    c. The <article> element should contain at least two sections. Use the <section> element to create the sections. Each section 
    should have at least two paragraphs (<p> elements).
    
    d. Add a <footer> element at the end of the document, which must contain your name, the date of creation, and a copyright symbol next to your name.

### Additional Notes on the Structure and Content of your Webpage:

7. In the <nav> element, you can initially add three empty paragraphs (<p>) without content, leaving
them blank for now.

8. Before the closing </body> tag, insert a footer using the <footer> element.

9. The first line in the <article> should display the name of your chosen topic (use the <h1> element to
ensure it’s the largest heading).

10. After the first line, add two line breaks (<br />) and write a short introductory paragraph about your
topic. You can use Wikipedia for inspiration, but be sure to rephrase it in your own words.

11. The footer you added earlier must include:

    - Your name, the date of the creation, and the copyright symbol.
    - These elements should be separated by a single space. Use HTML entities to insert the copyright symbol and space.

12. Use the following HTML elements to format parts of your content:

    <br> a. <em> for emphasized text.
    <br> b. <strong> for important text.</strong>
    <br> c. <mark> to highlight text. </mark>
    <br> d. <cite> for citing the title of a work.
    <br> e. <dfn> for defining terms.
    <br> f. <i> for italic text </i> and `<s>` for strikethrough text.
    <br> g. <b> for bold text. </b>
    <br> h. <center> to center text or elements. </center>
    <br> i. <big> for larger text.
    <br> j. <sub> for subscript text.
    <br> k. <small> for smaller text.

13. Include at least 10 special characters (symbols) of your choice, using both HTML entity names and
entity numbers (numeric codes).

### Styling Your Content with CSS using an External Stylesheet:

14. Create a separate CSS file (e.g., styles.css) and link it to your HTML document using the <link> element
in the <head> section of the HTML.

15. Use at least five different CSS properties to style the various sections of your HTML document. Below
are examples of sections you should style:

    a. Header Section:
        - Use the background-color property to set a background color for the header.
        - Apply font-family to change the font style of the header text.
        - Use text-align to center the content in the header.

    b. Article Section:
        - Add a border to separate the article from other sections.
        - Use padding and margin to add space around the content and make it more visually appealing.
        - Apply the line-height CSS property to increase the readability of paragraphs.

    c. Footer Section:
        - Use text-align: center; to center-align the text in the footer.
        - Apply color to change the text color (e.g., a light gray or white if using a dark background).
        - Use font-size to make the footer text smaller than the rest of the content.

16. Use the following CSS properties at a minimum, but feel free to add more as you see fit:

    - background-color
    - font-family
    - font-size
    - color
    - text-align
    - border
    - margin
    - padding
    - line-height

17. After applying the styles, ensure your webpage is well-organized and visually appealing.
